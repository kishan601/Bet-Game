## 📌 Features

### User Authentication
- JWT-based login and registration
- Secure password hashing
- Session management

### Card Matching Game
- **Board Layout:** 2 rows of 5 cards (10 cards total)

  - Cards flip on selection with smooth animations
  - Matched pairs remain open
  - Non-matched pairs flip back automatically
  - Limited attempts per game (default: 10 attempts)
  - Win condition: Successfully match 3 pairs
  - Lose condition: Exceed maximum attempts

### Anti-Cheat Logic
- **Dynamic Shuffling:** Cards reshuffle periodically during the game
- **Interaction-Based:** Shuffle stops immediately when user interacts with cards
- **Security:** Prevents memorization exploits and ensures fair gameplay

### Admin Panel
- View all registered users with detailed statistics
- Adjust user wallet balances manually

## 🧠 Game Logic Explanation

### Card Generation
1. Two identical arrays of numbers (1-5, each repeated twice for matching potential) are created
2. Both arrays are randomly shuffled independently
3. Cards are arranged in a 2×5 grid with the shuffled values

### Matching System
- User selects two cards from the board
- If card values match: Cards remain open, pair is marked as won
- If card values don't match: Both cards flip back, attempt count increases

### Attempt System
- Players start with a limited number of attempts (typically 10)
- Each failed match consumes one attempt
- Game ends in loss when attempts reach zero
- Successful matches don't consume attempts

### Shuffle Logic
- **Timer-Based:** Cards reshuffle every 8-10 seconds during gameplay (configurable)
- **Interaction Triggered:** On failed match, cards automatically reshuffle
- **Strategic Depth:** Forces players to adapt rather than memorize positions

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Win:** Match 3 or more pairs before attempts run out
- **Loss:** Fail to match 3 pairs within the attempt limit
- **Result:** Wallet automatically updated based on bet multiplier and game outcome

### Wallet Update
- Bet amount is deducted before game starts
- On win: Player receives bet amount × multiplier (e.g., 2× for 3 matched pairs)
- On loss: Bet amount is forfeited
- All transactions are logged and retrievable

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongoDB_uri here
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_secret_key_here
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:5173`

## 📌 Important Notes

⚠️ **Security & Setup:**
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- **Backend must be running first** before starting the frontend
- **Verify API URLs** to match your deployment environment
- Update `VITE_API_URL` with the production backend URL when deploying to production
- **JWT Secret** should be a strong, random string in production
- Use HTTPS in production to secure authentication tokens

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Test thoroughly in development before deploying
- Monitor backend logs for errors and suspicious activity
- Regularly back up MongoDB data
- Use environment-specific configurations for staging and production
